TODO
====

* Add `ClearCookie` to the examples, like for `permissions2` and `permissionbolt`
* Use the anti timing-attack from martini-contrib/auth/.
* Look into supporting HTTP basic auth, but only for some paths (see xyproto/scoreserver)
* Use a more international selection of letters when validating usernames (in `userstate.go`)
